# Squirrel Cryptocurrency Wallet (Django Project) #

## Introduction ##

We are a group of students from the Department of Computation of the Experimental
Faculty of Sciences (FEC) in Maracaibo, Venezuela.

The goal of our project is to create a wallet for educational purposes for the Subject
"Software Engineerings", so we can learn and understand better not only the inner
working of a wallet service, but also as a preparation for working in group projects.

Said wallet will have the most basic functions,like storing, sending and receiving
different kinds of cryptocoins(such as bitcoin, etherium, etc.)to other wallets and
will only be online for a short period of time, enough for us to test it and present it
as a class project, without any comercialization of any kind.
